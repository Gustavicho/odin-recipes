        <p>These air fryer chicken quesadillas are so easy to makeâ€”using cooked, shredded chicken, and melty cheese in a folded tortilla, and air frying, they're even easier than quesadillas usually are. This recipe was developed for a 5.3-quart, basket-style air fryer, so if yours is different, expect different cook times. Top with guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, cilantro sprigs, or any combination you like.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C), according to manufacturer's guidelines. Toss chicken with chili powder, cumin, and cayenne in a bowl.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place a tortilla on a work surface and cover half the tortilla with about 2 tablespoons grated cheese. Top with 2 tablespoons chicken mixture, then top with 2 additional tablespoons grated cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fold tortilla in half and use wooden picks to hold the tortilla halves together. Spray both sides of the filled tortilla with olive oil spray.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Air fry quesadillas in a single layer until tortillas are lightly browned and cheese is melted, about 4 minutes per side. You may have to cook in batches. Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</p>
